# CRUDPHPBOOK
One of my small projects during my college day

For this to work, you need to have XAAMP or Laragon. Open the Apache and My Sql and go to admin of Apache, you'll be redirected to php My admin. Now go to the database and create a database there.
Take note this only works in your localhost. Make sure to upload this inside the folder of htdocs in XAAMP or Laragon. After uploading you can now start it and access it in the browser anything can work. 
To be accessed you need to type it like this (this is not exactly how you should type it) http://localhost/crud_pdo/Jamero_Bootstrap7.php.
